## Quick Start Guide

### 1. **Choose Your Platform**
Select the integration that best fits your use case:
- **LiveKit** for professional video conferencing
- **FastRTC** for simple peer-to-peer connections
- **Shopify** for e-commerce applications

### 2. **Install Dependencies**
Each integration has specific requirements:
```bash
# LiveKit
pip install livekit-rtc livekit-api

# FastRTC  
pip install fastrtc

# Shopify
pip install shopify-python-api
```

### 3. **Configure Authentication**
Set up API keys and credentials for your chosen platform.

### 4. **Deploy Your Agent**
Follow the platform-specific deployment guide.

## Integration Comparison

| Platform | Complexity | Use Case | Real-time | Scalability |
|----------|------------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **LiveKit** | Medium | Video conferencing, streaming | ‚úÖ Yes | High |
| **FastRTC** | Low | Simple video calls | ‚úÖ Yes | Medium |
| **Shopify** | Low | E-commerce assistance | ‚ùå No | High |

## Development Workflow

### 1. **Local Development**
Start with local testing using the basic bitHuman SDK:
```python
from bithuman import AsyncBithuman

# Test your agent locally first
runtime = await AsyncBithuman.create(
    api_secret="your_secret",
    model_path="path/to/model.imx"
)
```

### 2. **Integration Setup**
Add platform-specific adapters and configuration:
```python
# Example: LiveKit integration
from integrations.livekit import LiveKitAdapter

adapter = LiveKitAdapter(
    bithuman_runtime=runtime,
    room_config=room_config
)
```

### 3. **Testing & Validation**
Test your integration thoroughly:
- Verify audio/video synchronization
- Test with multiple users
- Monitor performance metrics
- Validate error handling

### 4. **Production Deployment**
Deploy using platform-specific best practices:
- Configure monitoring and logging
- Set up auto-scaling
- Implement health checks
- Monitor usage metrics

## Best Practices

### üéØ **Performance Optimization**
- Use appropriate hardware for your integration type
- Implement efficient buffering for real-time streams
- Monitor latency and optimize accordingly
- Cache frequently accessed data

### üîí **Security Considerations**
- Implement proper authentication for all endpoints
- Use HTTPS/WSS for all communications
- Validate all input data
- Monitor for unusual usage patterns

### üìä **Monitoring & Analytics**
- Track key performance metrics
- Monitor user engagement
- Set up alerts for system issues
- Analyze usage patterns for optimization

### üõ† **Error Handling**
- Implement graceful fallbacks
- Provide clear error messages
- Log errors for debugging
- Set up automated recovery mechanisms

## Common Integration Patterns

### **WebRTC Streaming Pattern**
```python
# Real-time video streaming to web browsers
async def stream_to_webrtc(audio_input):
    video_frame, audio_chunk = await runtime.process_audio(audio_input)
    await webrtc_adapter.send_frame(video_frame, audio_chunk)
```

### **E-commerce Assistant Pattern**
```python
# Shopping assistance with product knowledge
async def shopping_assistant(user_query, product_context):
    response = await runtime.process_with_context(user_query, product_context)
    await ecommerce_adapter.send_response(response)
```

### **Chat Integration Pattern**
```python
# Text-based conversations with avatar responses
async def chat_integration(message):
    avatar_response = await runtime.generate_response(message)
    await chat_adapter.send_message(avatar_response)
```

# Prompt Guidelines

Creating effective prompts is crucial for generating high-quality bitHuman agents. This guide covers best practices for writing prompts that produce engaging, realistic avatars.

## Overview

When creating a bitHuman agent, your prompt defines:
- **Personality and behavior** - How the agent acts and responds
- **Voice characteristics** - Tone, style, and speaking patterns
- **Visual appearance** - Overall look and expressions
- **Interaction style** - How it engages with users

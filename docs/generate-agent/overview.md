# Generate bitHuman Agent Overview

> Learn how to create compelling and effective bitHuman agents with our comprehensive guidelines.

## What is a bitHuman Agent?

A bitHuman agent is a digital avatar powered by AI that can interact with users through realistic facial expressions, voice, and movements. Creating an effective agent requires careful attention to four key components: prompts, images, voice, and video behavior.

## Core Components

### 🎯 **Prompt Guidelines**
The foundation of your agent's personality and behavior. Well-crafted prompts ensure your agent responds appropriately and maintains consistent character throughout interactions.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Personality definition and tone
- Response style and formatting
- Context awareness and memory
- Behavioral boundaries and limitations

### 🎨 **Image Guidelines**
Visual appearance sets the first impression. High-quality images ensure your agent looks professional and engaging while maintaining visual consistency across different lighting and expressions.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Portrait composition and framing
- Lighting and background requirements
- Facial expression variety
- Technical specifications for optimal results

### 🎤 **Voice Guidelines**
Voice brings your agent to life. The right voice selection and audio quality ensure natural, engaging conversations that match your agent's personality and use case.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Voice selection and personality matching
- Audio quality and recording standards
- Speech patterns and cadence
- Multilingual considerations

### 🎬 **Video Guidelines**
Movement and animation create the illusion of life. Proper video guidelines ensure smooth, natural movements that enhance rather than distract from the conversation.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Animation timing and synchronization
- Gesture appropriateness and frequency
- Facial expression mapping
- Performance optimization

## Recording Best Practices

### Environment Setup

**Ideal Recording Space:**
- Quiet, treated room (carpets, curtains reduce echo)
- Minimal background noise
- Consistent temperature (affects voice)
- No interruptions during recording

**Equipment Recommendations:**
- **Good microphone** - USB condenser or dynamic mic
- **Pop filter** - Reduces plosive sounds (p, b, t, k)
- **Headphones** - Monitor recording quality
- **Audio interface** - For professional mics (optional)

### Recording Technique

**Microphone Position:**
```
✅ CORRECT:
- 6-8 inches from mouth
- Slightly off-axis to avoid breathing sounds
- Consistent distance throughout recording
- Pop filter between mouth and mic

❌ AVOID:
- Too close (causes distortion)
- Too far (loses presence)
- Inconsistent distance
- Direct breathing into mic
```

**Voice Preparation:**
1. **Warm up** - Vocal exercises, humming
2. **Hydration** - Water at room temperature
3. **Posture** - Sit or stand with good posture
4. **Breathing** - Deep, controlled breathing

### Sample Content Guidelines

#### Script Structure
```
Introduction (10-15 seconds):
"Hello, I'm [Agent Name]. I'm here to help you with [purpose/role]."

Main Content (60-90 seconds):
- Explain agent's expertise/role
- Demonstrate natural conversation style
- Show personality through delivery
- Include varied sentence structures

Interaction Examples (30-60 seconds):
- Sample responses to common questions
- Show different emotional responses
- Demonstrate problem-solving approach

Closing (10-15 seconds):
"I'm looking forward to working with you!"
```

#### Content Examples

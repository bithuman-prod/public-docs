## üîß Pro Tips for CO-STAR Success

### **‚úÖ Do This**

**Be Specific in Context**
```text
‚ùå "You work in customer service"
‚úÖ "You work as a Level 2 technical support specialist for a cloud software company, 
handling escalated cases from customers who've already tried basic troubleshooting"
```

**Use Professional Examples in Style**
```text
‚ùå "Be professional"
‚úÖ "Communicate like a McKinsey consultant - structured, data-driven, and confident 
while remaining accessible to non-experts"
```

**Define Clear Response Formats**
```text
‚ùå "Give helpful responses"
‚úÖ "Always structure responses as: Problem Summary | Root Cause Analysis | 
3 Recommended Solutions | Next Steps"
```

### **‚ùå Avoid This**

- **Vague objectives** - "Be helpful" vs "Increase customer satisfaction scores by resolving issues in under 5 minutes"
- **Conflicting tones** - Don't mix "professional" with "casual and fun"
- **Unclear audiences** - "Everyone" vs "Small business owners with 10-50 employees"
- **Missing context** - Jumping straight to objectives without setting the scene
